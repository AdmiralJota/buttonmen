Some of the configuration of Jenkins is easier done by hand, after
puppet has finished running:
 1. Manually enable Jenkins authentication (you can't setup users
    until you do this):
    * Browse to /configureSecurity
    * Check "Enable security".  The page should expand
    * Click "Jenkinsâ€™ own user database"
    * Click "Save"
 2. Setup users:
    * Setup configs and passwords for at least one user (yourself)
      by browsing to the UI /securityRealm/addUser item
    * You'll want to login as yourself and setup an SSH key at
      /me/configure.  Make sure to use a public key whose private
      key you don't mind bringing onto the jenkins system, since
      that's the easiest place to run the jenkins CLI.
 3. Setup config that requires auth:
    * Copy the config file into place and restart jenkins
sudo service jenkins stop
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/jenkins_config.xml /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
sudo service jenkins restart
    * Browse to the UI and verify that you can still see anything,
      but can't build or run or add a job
    * Login as yourself, and verify that you can run or add a job
