When a new developer comes on board and sets up a github branch:
 * Create an account for them so they can login and run jobs
 * Add a job from the cli, via:
sed -e 's/FIXME/username/' /usr/local/etc/jenkins_buttonmen_config.xml | jkcli create-job buttonmen-username
 * Login to the UI and build the job to get a baseline on all
   existing branches
